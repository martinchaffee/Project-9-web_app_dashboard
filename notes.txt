Still left to do:
--Create the notification icon in the bell icon.
--Icon left border on hover: extend to far left of nav bar
--JS to submit message form and display a confirmation the message was sent.
--Use JS to display error messages if user isn’t selected or message field is empty.

For Exceeds:
--Search function for message section
--Add autocomplete to search for users box
--Use local storage to save settings

Moving forward:

Can't put off JS any longer...
1)--Create the notification icon in the bell icon--
  I think this is going to have to be done with JS.
    Will need to create a little green circle that sits in the upper right hand corner of
    a div that icon-bell sits in.
      --when icon-bell is clicked, another alert box appears
      --closing the alert boxes causes the little green circle to disappear




2)--JS to submit message form and display a confirmation the message was sent.

3)--Use JS to display error messages if user isn’t selected or message field is empty.

For Exceeds:

4)--Search function for message section

5)--Add autocomplete to search for users box

6)--Use local storage to save settings
  Review "Using Local storage with JS" video and figure this out
